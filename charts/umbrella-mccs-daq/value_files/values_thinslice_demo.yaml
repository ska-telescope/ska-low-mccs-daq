#This deployment is aimed at oxford.
#This is a temporary file for performing the demo in MCCS-1203
#We want the following deployment:
# - TPM (x1)
# - DAQ (x1)
# - Subrack (simulated x1)
# - Jupyter Notebook (The configuration is defined in the default values.yaml file)

#Dissable all the TPMs except the one of interest.
#From spshw we want a TPM and a Subrack simulator
